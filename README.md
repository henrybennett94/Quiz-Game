## Technology Used
The Mystery Mansion Escapr Room Quiz Game leverages several modern web development technologies to create an engaging and interactive user experience. Here are the key technologies used:
### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of the web pages in this game. It provides the skeleton for the game's interface, defining elements such as buttons, images, and text content.
### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements. It enhances the visual presentation of the game by controlling the layout, colors, fonts, and overall look and feel. The game uses custom CSS as well as Bootstrap for responsive design.
### JavaScript
JavaScript is the programming language used to implement the gameâ€™s logic. It handles user interactions, such as checking answers, transitioning between rooms, and playing sounds. JavaScript makes the game dynamic and interactive.
### BootStrap
Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework used to simplify the design and layout of the game. Version 5.3.3 of Bootstrap is used in this project to ensure a responsive design that works well on various devices and screen sizes. It provides pre-styled components and utilities, which help in creating a cohesive and modern interface quickly.

By combining these technologies, the Mystery Mansion Escape Room Quiz Game provides a seamless and engaging experience for players. HTML lays the foundation, CSS and Bootstrap ensure a visually appealing design, and JavaScript brings the game to life with interactivity and logic.
